# Evaluation

The quality of the synthetic MWO data generated is evaluated using the following methods:

1. [Paths and Synthetic MWO Analysis](#paths-and-synthetic-mwo-analysis)
2. [Turing Test](#turing-test)
3. [Ranking Test](#ranking-test)

## Paths and Synthetic MWO Analysis

### Types of Paths

We analysed the MaintIE gold standard dataset using a Neo4j graph database to develop paths that illustrate relationships between equipment (*PhysicalObject*) and failure modes (*UndesirableEvent*). These paths are classified as direct, showing immediate connections, or complex, involving intermediary entities. Additional paths are created by using hierarchical relations between equipment entities. This framework improves our understanding of component relationships within MWOs and informs the synthetic data generation process.

### Number of Valid Paths 

We extracted 2,237 valid equipment-failure paths from the MaintIE KG, with the most common being State-Patient (1,208 paths). After SME validation, the number increased to 3,794, with significant gains in State-Agent-Activity and Process-Agent-Patient paths. The following table shows the number of valid paths before and after SME validation:

| Path Type               | Number of Valid Paths | Direct | Additional | Total before SME Validation | Total after SME Validation |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Object-Property         | 26                    | 23     | 49         | 49                          | 49                         |
| Process-Agent           | 77                    | 314    | 391        | 391                         | 391                        |
| Process-Patient         | 38                    | 231    | 269        | 269                         | 269                        |
| State-Patient           | 293                   | 915    | 1208       | 1208                        | 1208                       |
| Object-Property-State   | 1                     | 2      | 3          | 3                           | 3                          |
| State-Agent-Activity    | 25                    | 111    | 136        | 607                         | 607                        |
| State-Agent-Patient     | 7                     | 24     | 31         | 37                          | 37                         |
| Process-Agent-Patient   | 31                    | 119    | 150        | 1230                        | 1230                       |
| **Total**               | **498**               | **1739**| **2237**   | **3794**                     | **3794**                    |

### Path Distribution

An analysis of failure events and objects in the extracted paths revealed significant imbalance, with certain events and components overrepresented. For example, *leaking* accounts for 43% of paths, and *hose* appears in 34%. In contrast, events like *noisy* and *corroded* are underrepresented. Addressing this imbalance through sampling strategies is needed to create more balanced datasets.

| Undesirable Event    | Occurrence      | Physical Object   | Occurrence      |
|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Leaking              | 1700 / 3975     | Hose              | 1364 / 3975     |
| Unserviceable        | 241 / 3975      | Pump              | 297 / 3975      |
| Need replacing       | 238 / 3975      | Air conditioner   | 103 / 3975      |

### Sentence Length Distribution

In this analysis, we compared the sentence token distribution between human MWOs and synthetic MWOs generated by the LLM. The human MWO sentences comprised approximately 17,000 entries from the MaintIE gold and silver datasets and the MaintNorm dataset, while the synthetic MWOs totaled 10,000 sentences from various generations. The following graph shows the minimum, maximum, and average number of tokens per sentence for both datasets.

## Turing Test

The Turing test yielded an overall accuracy of **0.57**. This suggests that the synthetic MWOs were convincing enough to challenge expert evaluators' ability to differentiate between human and machine-generated text, as the target accuracy was **50%**.

| Metric                  | Value  |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Overall Accuracy        | 0.57   |
| Annotator Agreement      | 0.10   |

| Annotator | Accuracy | F1   | Precision | Recall | % Human |
|-----------|----------|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| A         | 0.58     | 0.63 | 0.56      | 0.72   | 0.64    |
| B         | 0.61     | 0.65 | 0.59      | 0.74   | 0.63    |
| C         | 0.53     | 0.54 | 0.53      | 0.56   | 0.53    |

## Ranking Test

Replicated the evaluation from [Bikaun et al. (2022)](https://github.com/nlp-tlp/cfg_technical_short_text). The synthetic data achieved a correctness score of **4.04 out of 5**, indicating effective grounding in retaining engineering relationships. The synthetic sentences were evaluated as **86%** as natural and **95%** as correct compared to their human counterparts.

| Attribute     | Human         | Synthetic   |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Naturalness   | 4.44 / 5      | 3.80 / 5    |
| Correctness   | 4.24 / 5      | 4.04 / 5    |
